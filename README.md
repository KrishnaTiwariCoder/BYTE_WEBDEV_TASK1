3. **Install Node.js and npm (or yarn):** Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.  You can download them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
4. **Install project dependencies:**  Open your terminal in the project directory and run `npm install`. This will install all the necessary packages listed in `package.json`.
5. **Run the application:**  After installation, run `npm run dev` to start the development server. This command uses Vite to build and serve your application.  The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

            ## 📖 Usage

            To run the application locally:

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/[your_username]/BYTE_WEBDEV_TASK1.git`
2. **Navigate to the project directory:** `cd BYTE_WEBDEV_TASK1`
3. **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
4. **Start the development server:** `npm run dev`

This will launch the application on `http://localhost:3000`.  You can then interact with the application and explore its features.

Example of a potential interaction (assuming a feature exists):

```javascript
//  Example interaction would depend on the application's functionality. 
//  This is a placeholder.  Replace with a relevant example once functionality is defined.
//  For example, if there was a button that changed text:
// document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', () => { ... });
```
